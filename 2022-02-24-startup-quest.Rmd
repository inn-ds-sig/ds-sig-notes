```

The results are in; we are starting a Data Science Special Interest Group! 

Twenty-four inn-employees from all but one faculty have shown interest in the group so far (see figure below). Answers in the questionnaire suggest that we should arrange a wide range of activities to cover interests in the group. For example, most of us are interested in data visualization and statistical programming, but I'm also looking forward to learning about general-purpose programming and collaborative coding. Most of the respondents wish to meet or have a scheduled activity once a month. This means that the program committee should get to work. It will be great!

The next step will be a gathering of the program committee. I will invite those of you who signed up for more work to a zoom meeting where we decide on this semester's activities. Maybe we will have the first planned activity sometime in April?

Best regards
Daniel
